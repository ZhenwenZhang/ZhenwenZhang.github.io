I first got introduced to self-supervised learning in a talk by Yann Lecun, where he introduced the “cake analogy” to illustrate the importance of self-supervised learning. In the talk, he said:

“If intelligence is a cake, the bulk of the cake is self-supervised learning, the icing on the cake is supervised learning, and the cherry on the cake is reinforcement learning (RL).”

Though the analogy is debated, we have seen the impact of self-supervised learning in the Natural Language Processing field where recent developments (Word2Vec, Glove, ELMO, BERT) have embraced self-supervision and achieved state of the art results.
